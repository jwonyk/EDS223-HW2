# Homework Assignment 2 - HOLC Redlining and Biodiversity Observations

## Purpose of this project

This project explores how historical redlining practices, a discriminatory neighborhood grading by Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the 1930s, which continued to linger and caused environmental and ecological conditions in Los Angeles today. We also have GBIF bird observation records to see the effects of socioeconomic and environmental factors. The goal is to show the legacy of structural discrimination in urban planning, even til today, using three elements:

-   Air Quality

-   Long-Term Health Outcome

-   Low Income

## Repository Structure

-   Publicly archived data from the EPA EJScreen, loaded in using `sf` package
